# hacker_news_webscrap
This is a web scrapper that goes into the Hacker News website and scraps for all main-page titles, bringing back the ones with at least 200 votes.

Currently it is on a scheduled run within github actions, running once per day, at 19:05 Brazil time (or 22:05 UTC); 

And, it is connected to a ntfy channel to send me a text with the news that follow the defined criteria, as shown in the screenshot down bellow:
